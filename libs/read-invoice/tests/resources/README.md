How CII 2 is Related to UN/CEFACT: Developed Under UN/CEFACT – The Cross-Industry Invoice (CII) 2.0
is an electronic invoicing standard that follows the UN/CEFACT modeling methodology, ensuring
interoperability and compliance with international trade standards.

Based on UN/CEFACT Core Components – CII 2 uses the Core Components Library (CCL) and the Business
Requirements Specifications (BRS) developed by UN/CEFACT, aligning it with other e-business and
trade-related standards.

Supports Global E-Invoicing – UN/CEFACT's CII 2 standard is widely used for cross-border and
domestic electronic invoicing in various regions, ensuring compatibility with regulatory frameworks
like Peppol BIS Billing and EN 16931.

Interoperability with Other Standards – CII 2 is designed to be interoperable with other UN/CEFACT
standards like the Cross-Industry Order (CIO) and Cross-Industry Despatch Advice (CID), making it
part of a broader electronic document ecosystem.
